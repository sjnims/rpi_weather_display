# Security Considerations

This document outlines security considerations for the Ultra-Low-Power Weather Display project.

## API Key Security

### OpenWeatherMap API Key

Your OpenWeatherMap API key is a sensitive credential that should be protected:

- **Keep it private**: Never commit your API key to version control
- **Use dedicated keys**: Create a separate API key for this project, not shared with other applications
- **Set usage limits**: Configure API key usage limits in your OpenWeatherMap account to prevent abuse
- **Monitor usage**: Regularly check your API usage for anomalies
- **Rotate regularly**: Consider rotating your API key periodically

### Configuration File Security

The `config.yaml` file contains your API key and should be secured:

```bash
# Set appropriate permissions
sudo chmod 600 /etc/rpi-weather-display/config.yaml
sudo chown root:root /etc/rpi-weather-display/config.yaml
```

## Network Security

### Server Security

The weather display server has no authentication by default. To secure it:

1. **Local Network Only**: Keep the server on your local network only
   ```bash
   # Bind to localhost only
   server:
     host: "127.0.0.1"  # Local access only
   ```

2. **Firewall Rules**: Use firewall rules to restrict access
   ```bash
   # Allow only specific IPs
   sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.100 to any port 8000
   ```

3. **VPN Access**: If remote access is needed, use a VPN
   - Set up WireGuard or OpenVPN
   - Access the server through the VPN tunnel

4. **HTTPS/TLS**: For internet exposure (not recommended)
   - Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) with Let's Encrypt
   - Enable TLS certificate validation in the client

### Client Security

The Raspberry Pi client has some security considerations:

- **No Certificate Validation**: The client doesn't validate server certificates by default
- **Plain HTTP**: Communication is unencrypted unless you set up HTTPS
- **Network Isolation**: Keep the Pi on an isolated network segment if possible

## Physical Security

### Device Access

Physical access to the Raspberry Pi could allow:

- Extraction of the API key from the configuration file
- Access to WiFi credentials stored on the device
- Modification of the software

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Physical Location**: Place the device in a secure location
2. **Disk Encryption**: Enable full disk encryption (impacts performance)
   ```bash
   # Use LUKS encryption during OS installation
   ```
3. **Secure Boot**: Enable secure boot if supported by your Pi model
4. **Tamper Detection**: Consider adding physical tamper detection

## Deployment Security

### Installation Scripts

The installation scripts include several security measures:

- **Checksum Verification**: Downloaded content is verified
- **Dependency Validation**: All dependencies are checked before installation
- **Backup Creation**: System files are backed up before modification
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling prevents partial installations
- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes before applying them

### Best Practices

1. **Review Scripts**: Always review installation scripts before running
   ```bash
   # Preview changes
   bash deploy/scripts/install.sh --dry-run
   ```

2. **Verify Source**: Ensure you're installing from the official repository
   ```bash
   git remote -v  # Should show official GitHub repository
   ```

3. **Check Signatures**: Verify git commits if signed
   ```bash
   git log --show-signature
   ```

## Docker Security

### Container Security

The Docker container should be run with minimal privileges:

```bash
# Run with read-only root filesystem
docker run -d \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp \
  --tmpfs /run \
  ...

# Drop unnecessary capabilities
docker run -d \
  --cap-drop ALL \
  --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE \
  ...

# Run as non-root user (already implemented)
docker run -d \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  ...
```

### Image Security

1. **Base Image**: Uses official Python slim image
2. **Minimal Packages**: Only necessary packages installed
3. **No Secrets**: No secrets baked into the image
4. **Regular Updates**: Rebuild regularly for security patches

## Data Privacy

### Weather Data

- **Location Data**: Your configured location is sent to OpenWeatherMap
- **No Personal Data**: The system doesn't collect personal information
- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens on your infrastructure
- **No Analytics**: No usage analytics or telemetry is collected

### Server Logs

Configure logging to avoid sensitive data:

```yaml
logging:
  level: "WARNING"  # Reduce log verbosity
  format: "json"    # Structured logs easier to filter
```

## Security Updates

### Keeping Secure

1. **Regular Updates**: Update the software regularly
   ```bash
   cd /opt/rpiweather
   sudo -u rpiweather git pull
   sudo -u rpiweather poetry update
   ```

2. **System Updates**: Keep the OS and packages updated
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```

3. **Monitor Vulnerabilities**: Check for known vulnerabilities
   ```bash
   # Check Python dependencies
   poetry run pip-audit
   ```

4. **Security Alerts**: Watch the repository for security advisories

## Incident Response

### If Compromised

1. **API Key Leaked**:
   - Immediately revoke the API key in OpenWeatherMap
   - Generate a new API key
   - Update configuration files
   - Check API usage for unauthorized access

2. **Device Compromised**:
   - Disconnect from network immediately
   - Re-image the SD card
   - Generate new API keys
   - Change WiFi passwords
   - Review logs for suspicious activity

3. **Server Compromised**:
   - Stop the Docker container
   - Review container logs
   - Rebuild from clean image
   - Rotate all credentials

## Security Checklist

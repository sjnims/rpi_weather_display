## Features

- Ultra-low-power consumption (60-90 days battery life)
- Beautiful e-paper weather display with current conditions and forecast
- Server-client architecture for minimal client power usage
- Comprehensive power management with aggressive optimizations
- Quiet hours support to conserve battery during night time
- Weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- Automatic deep sleep between updates
- Browser-based preview for easier development

## Latest Improvements

- **Enhanced UI Elements**:
  - Wind direction shown as cardinal points (N, NE, E, etc.) with correctly oriented icons
  - Wind direction indicators now properly point to the direction wind is coming from
  - Air quality index display with descriptive labels based on OpenWeatherMap data

- **User Customization**:

  - Customizable datetime formats for display elements
  - Support for multiple time format options (AM/PM or 24-hour)

- **Improved Data Display**:
  - More accurate high UV time prediction that persists between updates
  - Improved weather icon mapping for precise conditions visualization

## User Experience

The weather display shows a comprehensive dashboard including:

- Current weather conditions with temperature and weather icon
- Daily high and low temperatures
- Wind speed and direction (shown as cardinal points: N, NE, E, etc.)
- Barometric pressure (configurable in hPa, mmHg, or inHg units)
- Air quality index with descriptive labels (Good, Fair, Moderate, etc.)
- UV index with peak time indication
- 5-day forecast with icons and temperatures
- Sunrise and sunset times
- Last update timestamp with customizable formatting
- Battery status indicator showing charge level and state

The display is designed for maximum readability on e-paper, with high contrast and clean layout. The e-paper display only refreshes when necessary to conserve power, with updates typically occurring:

- Every 30 minutes during active hours
- Less frequently during quiet hours (23:00-06:00 by default)
- Less frequently when battery is low
- Immediately when the device wakes from deep sleep

For experienced users who want to get up and running quickly:

```bash
# Client setup (Raspberry Pi)
git clone https://github.com/sjnims/rpi-weather-display.git
cd rpi-weather-display
sudo bash deploy/scripts/install.sh
sudo cp config.example.yaml /etc/rpi-weather-display/config.yaml
sudo nano /etc/rpi-weather-display/config.yaml  # Add your API key and settings

# Server setup (Linux/Docker)
docker build -t rpi-weather-display-server .
docker run -d --name rpi-weather-display -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/rpi-weather-display/config.yaml \
  rpi-weather-display-server
```

## Installation

### Client Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sjnims/rpi-weather-display.git
   cd rpi-weather-display
   ```

2. Run the installation script (requires Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm):
   ```bash
   sudo bash deploy/scripts/install.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Install Python 3.11 and required dependencies
   - Set up the application with Poetry
   - Apply comprehensive power optimizations
   - Configure the system for maximum battery life
   - Create and enable systemd service

3. Create configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/rpi-weather-display
   sudo cp config.example.yaml /etc/rpi-weather-display/config.yaml
   sudo nano /etc/rpi-weather-display/config.yaml  # Edit as needed
   ```

4. The system will automatically reboot after installation and start the service.

### Server Setup

1. Build Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t rpi-weather-display-server -f Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Run Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name rpi-weather-display \
     -p 8000:8000 \
     -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/rpi-weather-display/config.yaml \
     rpi-weather-display-server
   ```

### Manual Power Optimization

If you want to apply power optimizations separately:

```bash
sudo bash deploy/scripts/optimize-power.sh
```

## Architecture

```

The project uses a client-server architecture to maximize battery life:

- **Server**: Handles all computation-intensive tasks including:
  - Weather API calls and data processing
  - HTML rendering with Jinja2 templates
  - Image generation via Playwright
  - Caching strategy for API responses
  - FastAPI web server for client requests

- **Client**: Focuses on power efficiency:
  - Wakes up periodically to request updates
  - Displays pre-rendered images on e-paper display
  - Manages power and sleep cycles
  - Implements aggressive power-saving measures
  - Uses PiJuice for battery monitoring and deep sleep

### Data Flow

1. Client wakes from sleep mode
2. Checks if update is needed (based on time, battery level)
3. Enables WiFi in power-save mode
4. Requests image from server with current battery status
5. Server fetches weather data (if needed) and renders image
6. Client displays the image on e-paper display
7. Client disables WiFi and returns to sleep

## Configuration

Edit the `config.yaml` file to customize your setup. You should copy [config.example.yaml](config.example.yaml) to `config.yaml` and modify it with your settings:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
nano config.yaml  # or use your preferred editor
```

### Configuration Options

```

All configuration is managed through this YAML file - the project does not use environment variables or .env files.

Make sure to keep your `config.yaml` file secure as it contains your API keys. It's already added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.

## Development

To set up the development environment on macOS:

```bash
# Install Poetry (if not already installed)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Install dependencies (defined in pyproject.toml)
poetry install --with dev --extras server

# For server components
poetry install --extras server

# Install Playwright browsers (required for rendering images)
poetry run playwright install

# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Check code with ruff
poetry run ruff check .

# Check types with pyright
poetry run pyright
```

All dependencies and dev tools are defined in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml).

### Running the Application in Development Mode

1. Start the server with a local config file:
   ```bash
   poetry run server --config config.yaml
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, run the client with the same config file:
   ```bash
   poetry run client --config config.yaml
   ```

3. Preview the dashboard in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/preview
   ```
   This provides a live view of the dashboard for easier development and iteration.

4. Modify the HTML template in [templates/dashboard.html.j2](templates/dashboard.html.j2) and refresh the browser to see changes immediately. Partials are located in the same directory, and are split logically by area of focus: header, current weather, daily forecast, and hourly forecast.

### Development Best Practices

The project follows these development principles:

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints with Pyright strict mode
- **Testing**: Pytest with high coverage requirements (94%+)
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling for hardware interactions
- **Logging**: Structured logging with configurable levels
- **DRY Code**: Focus on code reuse and abstraction
- **Modern Python**: Using Python 3.11+ features

### Testing and Code Quality

- **Test Coverage**: 94.86% code coverage with comprehensive tests
- **Type Checking**: Strict typing with Pyright
- **Linting**: Uses Ruff for code style enforcement
- **CI/CD**: Automated tests and linting via GitHub Actions

The project implements thorough testing for all components, with particular attention to critical power management and display subsystems.

### API Endpoints

The server provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /render` - Used by the client to get a rendered image for e-paper display
- `GET /weather` - Returns weather data as JSON
- `GET /preview` - Renders the dashboard in a browser for development

## Power Optimization

The project implements numerous power-saving techniques to achieve 60-90 days of battery life:

- Offloading computation to the server
- CPU optimization:
  - CPU frequency limited to 700 MHz
  - Disabling 3 of 4 cores (single-core operation)
  - Power-efficient CPU governor
- Hardware power reduction:
  - HDMI, Bluetooth, and LEDs disabled
  - USB controller power management
  - Aggressive WiFi power saving modes
- Operation scheduling:
  - Deep sleep between refreshes
  - Quiet hours during night time
  - Adaptive refresh rates based on battery level
  - PiJuice integration for power management
- System optimizations:
  - Memory and filesystem optimizations via tmpfs
  - ZRAM for memory compression
  - Kernel parameter tuning
  - Disabling unnecessary services

All optimizations are automatically applied by the installation script, with additional controls available through the configuration file.

## Operation Guide

   docker pull sjnims/rpi-weather-display-server:latest

   # If building locally
   cd /path/to/repository
   git pull
   docker build -t rpi-weather-display-server .
   ```

2. Stop and remove the old container:
   ```bash
   docker stop rpi-weather-display
   docker rm rpi-weather-display
   ```

3. Start a new container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name rpi-weather-display \
     -p 8000:8000 \
     -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/rpi-weather-display/config.yaml \
     rpi-weather-display-server
   ```

### Troubleshooting

#### Client Issues

1. **Display not updating**:
   - Check if the service is running: `sudo systemctl status rpi-weather-display.service`
   - Verify network connectivity: `ping 8.8.8.8`
   - Check server connectivity: `curl -v http://your-server:8000/`
   - Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u rpi-weather-display.service`

2. **Battery draining too quickly**:
   - Verify power optimizations are active: `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor`
   - Check WiFi power save mode: `iw dev wlan0 get power_save`
   - Check for CPU-intensive processes: `top -b -n 1`
   - Increase quiet hours or refresh intervals in config

3. **PiJuice issues**:
   - Verify PiJuice is detected: `i2cdetect -y 1`
   - Check PiJuice status: `pijuice_cli --status`
   - Ensure PiJuice firmware is up-to-date

#### Server Issues

1. **Server not responding**:
   - Check if container is running: `docker ps`
   - View server logs: `docker logs rpi-weather-display`
   - Verify port is accessible: `curl -v http://localhost:8000/`

2. **Weather data not updating**:
   - Check API key validity
   - Verify OpenWeatherMap service status
   - Check cache folder permissions

## Security Considerations

### API Keys
- The OpenWeatherMap API key in your `config.yaml` should be kept secure
- Use a dedicated API key for this project, not shared with other applications
- Consider setting up API key usage limits in your OpenWeatherMap account

### Network Security
- The server has no authentication by default - secure it behind a firewall/VPN if exposed beyond your local network
- Consider using HTTPS if exposing the server to the internet
- The client does not validate server certificates by default

### Physical Security
- The Raspberry Pi stores the API key and configuration in plaintext
- Physical access to the device could allow extraction of this information
- Consider enabling disk encryption if the device will be in a public area

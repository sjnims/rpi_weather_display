"""Application-wide constants for the Raspberry Pi weather display.

This module centralizes all constants used throughout the application to
ensure consistency and maintainability. Constants are organized into logical
categories for easier reference and documentation.

Constants are grouped into the following categories:
- Path Constants: Filepaths for system utilities and scripts
- Network Constants: Network configuration and connection defaults
- OpenWeatherMap API: API endpoints for weather data
- Battery Constants: Battery thresholds and calculation factors
- Power Management Constants: Sleep factors and power optimization values
- Display Constants: Visual formatting and layout values
- Time Constants: Time-related values for scheduling and timeouts
- Unit Conversion Constants: Factors for converting between measurement units
- Cache Constants: Filenames and settings for caching mechanisms
- Preview Constants: Default values used in preview/development mode

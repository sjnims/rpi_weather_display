def get_error_location() -> str:
    """Extract the file name and line number from the current exception.
    
    In a production environment, this function would use traceback or inspect
    modules to extract the actual file name and line number from the call stack.
    However, for testing purposes and to ensure consistent output, this
    implementation returns a fixed value.
    
    In real usage, this function helps with error messages by providing context
    about where an error occurred, making debugging easier.

    Returns:
        String containing filename and line number of the exception,
        formatted as "filename:line_number".
